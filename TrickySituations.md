# Introduction #

Because of the complexity of the game and all of the 81 scoring elements, sometimes situations can arise that is quite complex to score. This page contains a list of all situations that users have reported as incorrect/questionable. My hope is that some rules experts can have a look at the list and help me correct the scoring.

Should an _Edge_ _Wait_ be awarded to the _Pure_ _Terminal_ _Chows_-hand even though the _Seven_ _Pairs_-hand does not qualify for any Wait? Should the maximum points for the hand be 66 or 67? (As it is implemented right now the maximum points for the hand is 67.)
